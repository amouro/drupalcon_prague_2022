Good afternoon, I hope you all have a good DrupalCon in Prague. In this session I'm going to talk about things around how to localize user experiences. 
Especially experience in CJK languages.

We have many tool to help with translations, but understand how to localize the user experience can make the website design better.
If you don't know CJK yet, lets embrace some culture shock; If you are or may working on websites with CJK, I hope this will be helpful.

I already regret to submit the proposal for a short session when I making the slide. There are so much to talk, let's start the journey.

I'm a Taiwanese Drupal developer works in a international research institution in Japan. 
During my 14 years Drupal adventure (according to Drupal dot org), I designed and made websites in Traditional Chinese and Japanese and English.

I'm now working in a Japanese research institute which use English and Japanese as equaly important first language.
Our team always make sure the experience of both languages are well perceived.
